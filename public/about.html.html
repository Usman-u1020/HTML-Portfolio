<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Muhammad Khan, and I’m 16 years old. I love being active and playing sports, especially cricket and football. I also have a big interest in studying, particularly in technology. Right now, I’m in college studying Computer Science and Digital Development, which is all about learning how to create and manage websites.</p>

<p>Cricket and football have always been a big part of my life. I enjoy the excitement of playing these sports, whether I’m part of a team or playing with friends. Being active keeps me healthy and helps me make friends. Through sports, I’ve learned a lot about teamwork, dedication, and staying positive, even when things get tough. These lessons help me in both my sports and my studies.</p>

<p>Studying is important to me, and I enjoy learning new things. In college, my course in Computer Science and Digital Development is teaching me how to build websites. This is super exciting because I can combine my love for technology with my creative side. I’m learning programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are essential for making websites. Every project I work on helps me improve my skills and grow my knowledge.</p>

<p>I might also explore app development and digital marketing, as they are closely related to web development. I believe technology can really make a difference in people’s lives, and I want to contribute to that. Creating websites that help non-profit organizations or promote education and health is something I aspire to do. It’s important to me that my work has a positive impact on society.</p>
